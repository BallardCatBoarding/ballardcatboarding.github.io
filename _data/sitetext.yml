My two cats have different personalities and he made adjustments for them; giving space and gentle encouragement to my scaredy-cat and plenty of play and puzzles for my curious girl. I love that he meets the cats before the boarding and offers flexible drop off/pick up times.  As an overprotective cat lady, I recommend Ballard Cat Boarding."

  about:
    title: "About Us"
    text: ""
    body: "Established in 2020, Ballard Cat Boarding began as an informal service offered to close friends during their travels. As interest in boarding with us grew, we decided to open our home up to our local community.
      When you're away traveling, the last thing you need to be worrying about is how your beloved furry family member is doing back home. Our quiet and peaceful home makes it easy for cats to settle in, and our experienced, respectful approach ensures each cat's needs are met.
      We love providing daily updates that include pictures and behavioral observations for peace of mind. Have questions, or are ready to book? Send an inquiry our way through the form below! We can't wait to meet you."
